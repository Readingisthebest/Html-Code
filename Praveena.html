I really enjoyed the Harry Potter series. I appreciate J.K Rowlings hardwork on making this book. This fantasy fiction, drama, young adult fiction, mystery and thriller book is the most amazing read you will ever have. This might be a children's book but this series is great for all ages.
<h4> Percy Jackson Review 
Percy Jackson by Rick Riordan is a good children's read The genres for this is: Fantasy, Young adult fiction, Adventure, Children's literature. This book has a little cliffhangers in chapters which will come up in the next four chapters
